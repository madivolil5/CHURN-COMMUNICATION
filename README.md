## 4. DATA UNDERSTANDING
### The Data
The data used in this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset/discussion/235073) but it was for a prediction competition for [CrowdANALYTIX](https://www.crowdanalytix.com/contests/why-customer-churn). The dataset consists of one csv file. It contains 20 columns and  3333 records. Out of this 3333 record, there are 483 customers who churned and the remaining 2850 are non-churners. The column names are: 
- 
- list columns and their meaning
- Lastly, to validate this data reference was made to an article by [Data Bridge Market Research](https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-used-car-market)

### Data Preparation
The data was checked for missing values and some columns were found to have null values.The null values were handled by dropping all the rows with them.
Some columns were not in their appropriate data type so this was corrected to create a cleaner and easier to work with dataframe.
We also had duplicates in the data which we dropped.
